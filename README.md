# TechJoy-Challenge-Morning's Project

# Habit Hive Lite

A frontend‑only learning tracker built with React, Tailwind CSS, React Router, and Chart.js — using only `localStorage` for persistence. Perfect for rapid hackathon deployment under the theme “Transforming Together.”

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd habit-hive-lite
npm install
npm run dev


## Project Summary

**Vibe Code** is a web app created in just **4 days** as part of a hackathon challenge to build something **SLC: Simple, Lovable, and Complete**, inspired by the [SLC philosophy](https://longform.asmartbear.com/slc/).

Built under the theme **"Transform Together,"** this project is a testament to what can happen when a small team leans into creativity, collaboration, and just enough structure to build something real — and something people actually enjoy.

- **Simple** – No bloat, no overengineering — just what matters.
- **Lovable** – We focused on personality, playfulness, and user-first interactions.
- **Complete** – Delivered end-to-end with working features, polish, and deployment.

## Tech Stack

- **React** – For building composable, reactive UI components
- **JavaScript** – For expressive, client-side logic and functionality
